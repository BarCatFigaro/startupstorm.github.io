		<h2>Join a Team</h2>
		<p>
		Startup Storms looking for awesome people to join its team for the 2014/2015 semester. We are looking to fill positions for our two teams: The nwHacks Organizational Committee &#38; The Pitchit Shipit Meetup Series Team.
		</p>
		<p>
		Startup Storm started when a few UBC students got together and decided to do something about the lack of support and community student startups have at UBC. As a student-run organization, we actively promote and support student startups and entrepreneurship, along with a vibrant CS culture to power these startups through our events, resources, and local VCâ€™s.
